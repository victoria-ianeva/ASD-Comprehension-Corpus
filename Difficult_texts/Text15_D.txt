Non-Metals

Oxygen, carbon, sulphur and chlorine are examples of non-metal elements.
All non-metals have these properties in common:
* they are dull (not shiny)
* they are poor conductors of heat and electricity (they are insulators)
* they are weak and brittle (they easily break or shatter)
Most non-metals have these properties:
* they have a low density (they feel light for their size)
* they do not make a ringing sound when they are hit (they are not sonourous)
Eleven non-metals are gases at room temperature, including oxygen and chlorine. One non-metal, bromine, is a liquid at room temperature. The other non-metals are solids at room temperature, including carbon and sulphur. Carbon is a solid non-metal element. Pure carbon can exist in two very different forms - diamond and graphite.
