King Juan Carlos
King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted "kings don't abdicate, they die in their sleep''. But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down. So does the Spanish crisis suggest that monarchy is in its death throes? Is the writing on the wall for all European royals, with their Ruritanian uniforms and gilded lifestyles?
The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy. When public opinion is particularly polarised, as it was in the aftermath of the Franco regime, monarchs can rise above "mere" politics and "embody" a spirit of national unity. Juan Carlos undoubtedly played a key role in steering Spain from dictatorship to democracy, and was an influential defender of the new constitution during a military challenge in 1981.
The cultural gap between aristocratic royals and a more democratic populace was a major cause of Juan Carlos's fall. A century ago, hunting elephants in Botswana accompanied by a lady who was not one's wife would have been entirely normal – even expected – behaviour for a self-respecting monarch. But in 2012 it looked arrogant and out-of-touch, particularly at a time of economic crisis. And it is this insensitivity, together with a financial scandal involving his daughter, that forced this particular king to abdicate in the interests of his dynasty's survival.
