Power is leaching from David Cameron

Sunflowers turn their yellow faces to the sun, moths fly toward flame, and people in politics gravitate towards power. It’s nothing personal, obviously; moths don’t even get what flames are, let alone particularly like them, or else they’d surely understand that the meeting of candle and sadly flammable insect rarely ends well. But they can’t seem to help themselves, and that explains an awful lot of what you’re going to see at Conservative party conference in Manchester, starting on Sunday.
This will be the first gathering of the Tory clan since the prime minister casually admitted to the BBC’s James Landale, while chopping vegetables in his kitchen, that he doesn’t actually fancy a third term much. And by publicly confirming what has long been an open secret in his circle, he’s effectively declared open season on himself. Power naturally drains from people who decline to pursue it and while he should be greeted rapturously by the faithful in Manchester, having delivered the first governing Conservative majority since 1992, David Cameron’s flame now burns less brightly than it did. We are now within sight of a post-Cameron era in Conservative politics, and already rival lamps are discreetly being lit.
