Cells
Animal cells and plant cells contain tiny objects called mitochondria in their cytoplasm
Animal cells and plant cells both contain:
·	Cell membrane - Controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell
·	Cytoplasm - Jelly-like substance, where chemical reactions happen
·	Nucleus - Carries genetic information and controls what happens inside the cell
·	Mitochondria - Where most respiration reactions happen
Plant cells also contain these parts, which are not found in animal cells:
·	Cell wall - Made of a tough substance called cellulose, which supports the cell
·	Vacuole - Contains a liquid called cell sap, which keeps the cell firm
