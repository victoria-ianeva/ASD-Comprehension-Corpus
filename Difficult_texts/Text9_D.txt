Revival of the Western
The TV western seemed to fade into the sunset some time in the mid-1970s, victim of a narcissistic age that preferred to look at prosperous, smart-alecky or violent images of itself (Dallas, Cheers, Miami Vice). It was a time when children were encouraged to fantasize about machines and outer space rather than marvel at the open spaces where the deer and buffalo roamed.  
One of the most successful Hollywood TV producers, David Jacobs, the creator of Dallas, believes the western also fell victim to late 1960s iconoclasm. “The John Wayne stereotype was rejected, along with his conservative values”, he said.  
A series of spoof or obsessively realistic 1960s westerns (Cat Balou, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Soldier Blue, The Wild Bunch) stripped the mask from the Lone Ranger's face. The legend could not be taken seriously any longer in what had been, admittedly, a threadbare form. Howard Rosenberg, TV critic of the Los Angeles Times, said: “Just look at the re-runs of the old western series. You had heroes scotch-taped to their horses and lightly sprinkled with dust. You can't get away  with that  anymore.”
