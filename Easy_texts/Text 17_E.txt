Superstition

From the prehistoric times onwards disease was explained by supernatural beliefs.  Prehistoric people believed evil spirits caused diseases and they would use crystals, shamans and local medicine men to scare/persuade the evil spirit into leaving the body.  Trephined skulls have been discovered by archaeologists who believe prehistoric people may have cut holes into the skull to allow evil spirits to escape the body. Just like modern day Aboriginals, prehistoric peoples may have buried their hair, nails and faeces so evil spirits would not use them to cast spells against them.
The ancient Egyptians believed in many Gods some of which had both the power to cause disease, such as Seth, and the power to treat illnesses such as Osiris and Horus.  The Goddess Bes was thought to protect pregnant women. Priests said prayers and used charms to drive away the evil spirits which they believed caused disease.
