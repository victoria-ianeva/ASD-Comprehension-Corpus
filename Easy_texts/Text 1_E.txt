Playing Safe
The clock shows five seconds left in the game. Your team is losing by just one goal. You want to take the ball and score a goal. But you are cheering from the sidelines because you injured your leg. According to doctors, however, many sports injuries can be prevented.
Each year, about 20 million kids play sports during and after school. Unfortunately, about 5 million of those kids suffer some kind of injury while playing.
You can do a few things to keep from getting a sports injury:
* Do warm-up stretches before and after playing any sport. Stretching helps loosen tight muscles and tissues.
* Do not play when you are in pain. Pain is a sure sign of an injury!
* Use proper sports safety equipment, such as helmets, elbow pads, kneepads, safety glasses, wrist guards, shin guards, and mouth guards.
* Playing sports and exercising help kids stay healthy and make friends. But no matter which sport you play, always remember to have fun!
