Not so fast, cheetah! Researchers have finally found a way to keep up.

Experts in Namibia are using a computer system to identify and track the speedy cats by their paw prints. Namibia is a country in Africa.
First, researchers find and take pictures of wild cheetahs’ footprints. Next, they store the photos on a computer. Whenever a new print is added, the computer compares it to all the other prints for a match. No two cheetah paw prints are the same. That helps researchers know whether they have found the same cat twice.
Why the fancy footwork? Cheetahs are threatened. By knowing how many cats there are and where they live, scientists can help conserve them. To conserve is to keep safe. So far, researchers have recorded the prints of about 15 wild cheetahs, but they hope to find more.
