A for the brick facing St Paul's: Bankside Power Station is a masterpiece
Bankside Power Station should never have been built. Its architect had spent the war years with fellow Royal Academicians planning the orderly and spacious London of the future, free of smoke and industry. But, when asked in 1947 to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since 1891, he soon forgot such idealism and, like any architect, was glad to have the job.  
The project was controversial and the power station was only permitted providing the smoke was clean and the building did not challenge the visual dominance of St Paul's cathedral. So the single chimney rose only to 325ft, some 45ft below the height of the cross above the cathedral. The irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak “scrubbers” been less efficient, the smoke would have gone straight up into the air. As it was, the “smokeless shimmer of vapour” was so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river.
