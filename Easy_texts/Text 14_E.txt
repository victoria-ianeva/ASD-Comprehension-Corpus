Dragonflies 

Imagine having the ability to appear still even while you’re moving. Dragonflies have mastered that skill. Scientists recently discovered that male dragonflies use movement as a form of camouflage.
Many animals use camouflage to blend into their surroundings. Some butterflies, for example, have patterns that let them hide among leaves and twigs. Most animals, however, can remain unseen only while they stay very still. That’s why this new dragonfly finding has many scientists puzzled.
The dragonfly uses motion camouflage to fool its prey into thinking that it’s not moving and not a threat. The dragonfly’s prey include other insects it feeds on, such as mosquitoes and moths.
Researchers say that the dragonfly carefully changes position again and again as it closes in on its target. The dragonfly appears, to the eye of its prey, to remain in the same place--but in fact it’s moving. What a clever eye trick!
