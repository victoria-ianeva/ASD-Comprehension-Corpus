1.	Every child is different
Education helps children and young people learn skills for when they grow up. It is really important that everyone involved in education understands the needs of every child or young person and works with them so that they can learn all of the skills they need.
Children or young people on the autism spectrum need:
•A setting that is calm and well planned.
• To know what is happening – especially when people are in transition (moving from children’s services to adult services).
• To be talked to and included in decisions about education.
